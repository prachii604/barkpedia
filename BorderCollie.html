    <h1>Border Collie</h1>
    <div class="intro">This breed is extremely driven, loyal, and hard-working. Border collies are happiest when they are working or playing, and will only settle down for cuddle time when the workday is done. Therefore, these dogs do best in homes with large, fenced yards, as well as on farms and ranches, rather than apartments.</div>

        </h2>
        <h4>
            Border Collies do best in homes with access to a yard or outdoor space where they can run and play. They are not well-suited to apartment living unless they receive ample exercise and mental stimulation.</h4>
