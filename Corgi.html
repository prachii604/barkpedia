    <h1>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h1>
    <div class="intro">The Pembroke Welsh corgi is a small- to medium-sized herding dog of short stature and sturdy build. Known for their low-set body, large erect ears, and stubby tail, the Pembroke also has a reputation for being a wonderful companion. Pembroke Welsh corgis are achondroplastic, a dwarf breed with shortened legs. They are the shortest breed of the herding dog group.</div>
