            Lifestyle and Time Commitment:
        </h2>  
        <h4>
            Golden Retrievers are active dogs that require regular exercise and mental stimulation. Owners should be prepared to spend time playing with them, walking them, and providing training and socialization.

            Space and Living Arrangements: 
        </h2>
        <h4>
            While Golden Retrievers are adaptable and can live in various environments, they thrive in homes with access to a yard or outdoor space where they can run and play. They are also well-suited to apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.

            Owning a Golden Retriever can be costly. In addition to the initial cost of purchasing or adopting a dog, owners should budget for food, grooming, veterinary care, training, and supplies. They should also be prepared for potential medical expenses, such as those related to hip dysplasia or other health issues.
