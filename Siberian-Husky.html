    <h1>Siberian Husky</h1>
    <div class="intro">The Siberian husky is a graceful, athletic dog with high endurance and an eagerness to work. This friendly dog breed, which originated in Northeast Asia as a sled dog, has a vivacious and mischievous personality. Though these are high-energy and sometimes intense dogs, huskies can be affectionate and gentle when given proper care. They were brought to America through Alaska. Here's how the factors mentioned earlier apply to owning a Siberian Husky:</div>

        <h4>

            Space and Living Arrangements: 
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Siberian Huskies are medium to large-sized dogs that do well in homes with a yard where they can run and play. They can adapt to apartment living if given enough exercise, but having access to outdoor space is ideal.</h4>

            Owning a Siberian Husky can be costly. In addition to the initial cost of purchasing or adopting a dog, owners should budget for food, grooming, veterinary care, training, and supplies.
