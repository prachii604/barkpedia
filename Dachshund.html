    <h1>Dachshund</h1>
    <div class="intro">Dachshunds are daring, curious, and playful dogs who enjoy digging, hunting, and tracking. While they can be shy around strangers, they are quick to defend family members if they sense danger. Wirehaired doxies tend to have bolder personalities while the miniatures are the most timid of the three.</div>
